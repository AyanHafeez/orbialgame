Hi! 

Welcome to LoopHole, made by Orbial Gaming- 

Just some quick dev notes - This cannot run on browsers other than GOOGLE CHROME - due to some canvas lag, partly due to ctx functions that aren't well optimized(like shadowBlur). This is being further researched. 

If the page is not visible , or cut off - it's a scaling issue. This generally occurs on laptops. IF you zoom out your screen slightly, this helps the issue and usually is functional at that point. 

If there are any questions, comments, or concerns, please don't hesitate to email the developers, Ayan Hafeez and Alex Chen.

There are comments made in the code, indicating any sources. 

Controls: 

WASD = move
Shift = shoot
There is a draggable upgrade menu

Notes: In case of a spawn kill, please reload the page
	The objective of the game is to collect tobacco to fill the bar in the bottom left. 
	There is a settings screen and a customization screen.
