Hi! 

Welcome to LoopHole, made by Orbial Gaming- 

Just some quick dev notes - This cannot run on browsers other than GOOGLE CHROME - due to some canvas incompatibility. This is being further researched. 

If the page is not visible , or cut off - it's a scaling issue. This generally occurs on laptops. IF you zoom out your screen slightly, this helps the issue and usually is functional at that point. 

If there are any questions, comments, or concerns, please don't hesitate to email the developers, Ayan Hafeez and Alex Chen.

There are comments made in the code, indicating any sources.
